Recall  that the process of "compiling" this source  code into  an  executable  program  via  make actually involves four distinct phases, though not necessarily in this order: assembling, compiling, linking, and preprocessing. With  respect  to  this program, describe what happens during each of those phases, in at least one sentence per phase, in the order in which those phases occur.

```c 
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	string s = GetString();
	printf("hello,  s\n", s);
}
```
