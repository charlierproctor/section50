Consider the program below. 
- Why is line 1 present? line 2?
- What does the `void` signify in `int main(void)`?
- Explain, with respect to memory, exactly what `GetString` returns.

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	string s = GetString();
	printf("hello,  s\n", s);
}
```
