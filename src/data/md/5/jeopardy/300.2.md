Suppose  that  you've   forgotten  which  header  file  declares  `strlen`,  and  so  you need to re-implement it yourself (even if you didn't just use it). Bah. Even worse, neither `[` nor `]` currently  works on  your  keyboard (or  pencil  or  pen).    Without  calling  any  functions  at  all and  without  using  any  square  brackets,  complete  the  implementation  of  strlen below using pointer arithmetic in such a way that the function returns the length of `s`. If `s` happens to be `NULL`, your implementation of `strlen` should return `0`.
