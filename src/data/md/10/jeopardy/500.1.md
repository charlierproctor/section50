Suppose that a bank relies on a SQL table called `accounts` to store customers' accounts, wherein number (the table's `PRIMARY key`) represents a user's 12-digit account number, and balance represents how much money the customer has in his or her account, per the (incomplete) schema below. As per the default value of `100.00` for balance, the bank gives customers $100 anytime they open an account.

1. Complete the schema for accounts above by specifying, next to number and balance on the schema itself, an appropriate SQL type for each.
2. Suppose that the bank imposes a $20 "monthly maintenance fee" on all accounts. With what SQL query could the bank deduct $20 from every account (even if it results in some negative balances)?
