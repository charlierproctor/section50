Suppose that a bank relies on a SQL table called `accounts` to store customers' accounts, wherein number (the table's `PRIMARY key`) represents a user's 12-digit account number, and balance represents how much money the customer has in his or her account, per the (incomplete) schema below. As per the default value of `100.00` for balance, the bank gives customers $100 anytime they open an account.

1. With what SQL query could the bank retrieve the account numbers of its richest customers, those with balances greater than $1,000?
2. With what SQL query could the bank close (i.e., delete) every account that has a balance of $0?
