Consider the PHP array below.

```php
$quad = ["Cabot House", "Currier House", "Pforzheimer House"];
```

Complete the code fragment below in such a way that it outputs an unordered (i.e., bulleted) list of houses by iterating over `$quad`.  Assume that `$quad` is in scope. Take care to close the `ul` tag that we've opened for you, but no need to add elements like `html`, `head`, or `body`. Recall that `ul` elements have `li` (i.e., list item) elements as children.

```php
<ul>
	<?php
```
