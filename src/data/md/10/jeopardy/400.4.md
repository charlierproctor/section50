Complete the implementation of the web page below in such a way that if someone visits the page, inputs his or her name, and then submits the form, he or she is greeted via a call to alert with a window like that at right. If a user fails to input a name before submitting the form, no alert should appear. You are welcome, but not required, to use jQuery functions.
