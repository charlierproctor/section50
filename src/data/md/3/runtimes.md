## Asymptotic Notation

`O` notation describes an **upper bound** on an algorithm's running time.
- algorithm's worst case running time.
- For the curious, [bigocheatsheet.com/](http://bigocheatsheet.com/).

&#937; notation describes a **lower bound** on an algorithmâ€™s running time
- algorithm's best case running time.

| Algorithm 		| O(n) 		| &#937;(n) |
|-------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Selection Sort 	| `n^2` 	| `n^2`		|
| Insertion Sort 	| `n^2` 	| `n` 		|
| Bubble Sort 		| `n^2` 	| `n` 		|
| Merge Sort		| `n log(n)`| `n log(n)`|
