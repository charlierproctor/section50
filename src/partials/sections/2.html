		### What is section?
 
		- "sections provide you with opportunities to explore the course's material in a more intimate environment as well as to dive into hands-on activities"
		- You'll get the most out of section if you've watched the lectures and read the pset spec ahead of time.

		### A Quick Note on Grading

		- 5's are rare. There's always room for improvement!
		- Read the comments, please! This is how you will improve.
		- Graded in terms of progress from beginning to end.

		## Arrays

		To make an array, we do:

		```c
		&lt;data type&gt; &lt;name&gt;[&lt;size&gt;];
		int score[5];
		char alpha[26];
		```

		To put values in the array:

		```c
		score[0] = 0; // zero index all arrays!
		score[1] = 1;
		score[2] = 2;
		```

		Or, we can initialize as such:

		```c
		int score[] = {1, 2, 3}; // size based on the number of entries
		```

		### Let's try it!

		1. Create an array with the names of **three** people from section. 
		2. Loop over those names, printing them out to the command line. Make sure to add a `\n` after each!	

			```bash
			charlie@ide50:~/workspace $ ./arrays
			David Malan
			Brian Scassellati
			Jason Hirschorn
			```

		## Strings

		Although we can use the `string` declaration to declare strings, `strings` are really just arrays of characters.

		- `string` and `char[]` are exactly equivalent!
			- Where could I go to see this?
		- If I declare a `string s = "Section50"`, I can access the letters:

			```c 
			s[0] = 'S';
			s[1] = 'e';
			```

		- If I attempt to access the letter one past the end, I'll get the null terminating character, `\0`.

		### Let's try it!

		1. Create a `string` of your team's name. 
		2. Print it out, letter by letter.
			
			```bash
			charlie@ide50:~/workspace $ ./letters
			T
			e
			a
			m
			5
			0
			```

		## Functions

		- Functions take in `[parameters]`, do something `[methods]`, and spit out an answer `[return value]`.
		- Why do we want functions?
		- We've already seen one: `int main(void)`
			- `int` is the return type
			- `main` is the function name
			- `void` is the parameter, which in this case is nothing
		- Must declare functions before they're used: prototypes.

		```c 
		// this is my prototype -- must appear before `useful` is called.
		int orderPizza(int number);

		// print the number of pizzas ordered.
		int orderPizza(int number) {
		    printf("You ordered %i pizzas.\n", number);
		}
		```

		### Scope

		- Functions have their own scope.

		```c
		// GOOD

		int orderPizza(int number);

		int main(void){
			string num = 15;
			orderPizza(num);
		}

		// we pass in the number of pizzas we want
		int orderPizza(int number) {
			// `number` passed in as argument
			printf("You ordered %i pizzas.\n", number);
		}
		```

		---------------

		```c
		// BAD

		int orderPizza();

		int main(void){
			string num = 15;
			orderPizza();
		}

		// we don't pass anything in
		int orderPizza() {
			// `num` is not accessible here!!
			printf("You ordered %i pizzas.\n", num);
		}
		```


		### Let's try it!

		1. Create a function `printer` that prints whatever you pass to it. 
			```bash
			charlie@ide50:~/workspace $ ./functions
			Please give me a string: I want to ride my bicycle.
			I want to ride my bicycle.
			```

		## Command-Line Arguments

		- command line arguments allow you to pass arguments into a program
		- So now `int main(void)` becomes `int main(int argc, char* argv[])`
			- `argc` is the number of arguments passed to the program
			- `argv[]` is an array of strings, or `char *`'s that were passed to the program

			```bash
			charlie@ide50:~/workspace $ ./mario 8
			```

			- What are `argc` and `argv`?

		- You can treat these arguments as a multidimensional array, eg. `argv[0][2]`.

		### Let's try it!

		1. Take in a string **from the command line**.
		2. Print out every other letter.
			
			```bash
			charlie@ide50:~/workspace $ ./commandline lololcats
			lllas
			charlie@ide50:~/workspace $ ./commandline banana
			bnn
			```

		## PSet Review

		- Crypto this week!
			- User inputs how many positions to rotate characters in target word.

			```bash
			charlie@ide50:~/workspace $ ./caesar 1
			Charlie
			Dibsmjf
			```

		- All command line arguments are strings!
			- use `atoi()`
		- Be careful about rotating too far. (`%` hint, hint...)
		- Vigenere: in place of an `int`, you'll use a `string` to encrypt the target word.

		### Practice: Modulo

		### Practice: ASCII

		1. Take a string from the command-line.
		2. Print out the ASCII value of each character in the string, separated by a `\n`.

			```bash
			crp43@ide50:~/workspace $ ./test abcdef
			97
			98
			99
			100
			101
			102
			```
